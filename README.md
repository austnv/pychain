# pychain 🐍
A Python blockchain model that mimics the behavior of a real cryptocurrency depending on the set parameters. In the process of development.

## In the plans
- add visualization of the dynamics of changes in various variables: mining reward, mining difficulty, block generation time, etc
. - prediction of dynamics using interpolation and regressions
- In the future, I want to make this project a library in [PyPI](https://pypi.org/) to create your own blockchain 💚
